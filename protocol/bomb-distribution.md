# BOMB Distribution

At the beginning of every epoch, if the time-weighted average price (TWAP) of BOMB is greater than 1.01, new BOMB will be minted in the [Boardroom](earning-opportunities/boardroom.md).

The amount of new BOMB distributed depends on our position above peg and also the current circulating supply of BOMB.

| Circulating Supply | Max BOMB Minted    |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 500k or less       | ~~4.5% expansion~~ |
| Up to 1M           | ~~4% expansion~~   |
| Up to 1.5M         | ~~3.5% expansion~~ |
| Up to 2M           | 3~~% expansion~~   |
| Up to 5M           | ~~1.5% expansion~~ |
| Up to 10M          | 1.375% expansion   |
| Up to 20M          | 1.25% expansion    |
| Up to 50M          | 1.125% expansion   |
| 50M+               | 1% expansion       |
