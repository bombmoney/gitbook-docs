* [x] Initial website redesign. _(Completed Q4 2021)_
* [ ] Complete website revamp to make our core features much easier to understand and to allow for simpler participation in the protocol. ([Ongoing here](https://max.bomb.app/home))
* [x] Complete documentation revamp. _(Completed Q1 2022)_
* [x] Autocompounding vaults. _(Completed Q4 2021)_
