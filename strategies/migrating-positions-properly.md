# Migrating Positions Properly

To allow for the BOMB protocol to stay healthy, it is essential that we all work as a team by minimizing sells on our tokens, especially BOMB, whilst we are under 1.10 peg (minimal 1.05 peg). We offer many incentivized farms which users bounce between very often. The following guide was created to help our investors enter each farm with minimal impact to the protocol, making sure everybody wins! If you have any further questions after reading this article, please talk to our support staff in Discord or Telegram.
